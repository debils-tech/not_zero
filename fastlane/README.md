This directory exists because of the F-Droid build process.
F-Droid is using the same directory structure as Fastlane for the app metadata.

Because F-Droid expects the metadata to be located in the root of the repository we need to have this symlink.
Actual path to the android metadata is [/apps/not_zero_app/android/fastlane/metadata/android](/apps/not_zero_app/android/fastlane/metadata/android/)
