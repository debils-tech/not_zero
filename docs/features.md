- Quick task creation from the home screen

### Tags & Sublists

### Themes

- Light and dark theme support
- Dynamic color on supported platforms

### Settings

If you add a new feature, please:

1) Document it here with a short summary and key capabilities
2) Consider adding a dedicated section under your feature directory with deeper docs if needed
3) Keep the structure consistent with the app architecture described in `docs/architecture.md`
