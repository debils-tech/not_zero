# Repository understanding and authoring rules for Cursor

## Summary of the repository

- This is a Flutter + Dart monorepo managed by Melos.
- Main app lives in `apps/not_zero_app` with features under `lib/src/features/`.
- Shared technical packages live under `packages/` and should encapsulate reusable capabilities:
  - `nz_drift` — Drift/SQLite database
  - `nz_boxes` — key‑value storage (Shared Preferences)
  - `nz_common`, `nz_base_models`, `nz_flutter_core`, `nz_logger` — shared utilities
- Routing is in `apps/not_zero_app/lib/src/routes.dart` using `go_router`.
- State management/DI is `flutter_riverpod`; providers typically live in a feature `di.dart`.
- Codegen uses `freezed` + `json_serializable` (run via Melos scripts).
- Pinned Flutter version is in `.fvmrc`.
- Habits feature (recurring habit tracking with per‑day completions and history) lives in `apps/not_zero_app/lib/src/features/habits/`.

## Mandatory reading for agents

- Always read `docs/README.md` and `docs/architecture.md` before making changes.
- When working on or proposing a new feature, consult `docs/feature_spec_template.md` and update `docs/features.md`.
- Respect package boundaries: UI code in the app must not access services directly; go through repositories/notifiers.

## Authoring guidance

- Prefer placing cross‑feature technical utilities into a `packages/` module.
- Keep each feature self‑contained under `apps/not_zero_app/lib/src/features/<feature>/` with the structure:
  - `services/`, `repositories/`, `notifiers/`, `view/` (+ optional `models/`, `utils/`, `di.dart`).
- Add or update Riverpod providers in `di.dart` within the feature.
- Update `lib/src/routes.dart` for navigation changes.
- Use Melos scripts from the workspace root for code generation, test, and formatting.

## Commands cheat‑sheet

- Bootstrap workspace: `dart run melos bootstrap`
- Generate code: `dart run melos generate`
- Analyze: `dart run melos exec flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos`
- Test: `dart run melos run --no-select test`
- Build examples: `make build-android`, `make build-linux`

## Documentation maintenance

- Whenever adding a feature or materially changing behavior:
  1) Create/update a spec using `docs/feature_spec_template.md`
  2) Summarize in `docs/features.md`
  3) If architectural boundaries change, update `docs/architecture.md`
