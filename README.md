## Building and running

First of all app is built using Flutter SDK.
To install it follow [**the official guide**](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

```bash
# First, get all the dependencies
dart run melos bootstrap

# Go to the flutter app directory
cd apps/not_zero_app
# Run the app
flutter run
```

SQLite3 is required for this app to function.
On Android, iOS, Linux platforms it works out of the box: sqlite lib already included in the package. Other platforms wasn't tested yet.

For backup feature to work properly on Linux it is required to have dialog library be installed.
It can be either `zenity` (for GTK), `qarma` (for Qt), `kdialog` (for KDE).
